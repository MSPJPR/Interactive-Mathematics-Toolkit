Project Title:

Interactive Mathematics Toolkit

Description:

The Interactive Mathematics Toolkit is a web-based application designed to help students and researchers perform essential calculations in Vector Algebra and visualize Probability Distributions. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be executed directly in a web browser 

Features:

1. Vector Algebra Calculations:

Dot Product: Calculates the dot product of two vectors.

Cross Product: Calculates the cross product of two 3D vectors.

Magnitude: Computes the magnitude of a vector.

Error Handling: Provides alerts for invalid inputs or mismatched vector dimensions.



2. Probability Distribution Visualization:

Generates and visualizes random probability distributions using a bar chart powered by Chart.js.

Allows users to visualize data with clear, intuitive charts.



3. Responsive UI Design:

Simple and clean user interface with responsive elements for seamless use on mobile devices and desktops.



4. Technology Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Visualization Library: Chart.js (loaded via CDN)




Files Included:

1. index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web application.


2. styles.css: The CSS file for styling the web page to ensure a user-friendly design.


3. app.js: The JavaScript file containing all the logic for calculations and visualization.

How This Project Stands Out:

1. Real-Time Calculations: Offers interactive, real-time calculations for vector algebra.


2. Visualization: Adds a dynamic way to visualize data distributions.


3. Mobile Compatibility: Designed to run smoothly on mobile environments via Termux.


4. Lightweight: No need for complex libraries or dependencies like NumPy or TensorFlow.


This toolkit provides an engaging and educational tool for mathematics learners and researchers while demonstrating your web development skills effectively.
